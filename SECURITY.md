# Security Vulnerability Reporting

If you believe you have identified a security vulnerability in this project, please send email to the project
team at opensource@bloomberg.net, detailing the suspected issue and any methods you've found to reproduce it.

Please do NOT open an issue in the GitHub repository, as we'd prefer to keep vulnerability reports private until
we've had an opportunity to review and address them.
